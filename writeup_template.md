**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 6 steps. 
1. I converted the images to grayscale,

2. I blurred the image.
3. I applied canny edge with low thresh:70 high thresh:100
4. define a polygon for point of interest
5. make a Hough transform with threshold : 10, min_line_length = 100, max_line_gap = 200
6. apply line images from step 5 to original image

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
